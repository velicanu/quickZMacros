The recorded PbPb data sample was reconstructed with CMSSW software versions CMSSW\_7\_5\_8\_patch1 and CMSSW\_7\_5\_7\_patch2 with Global Tag 75X\_dataRun2\_PromptHI\_v3. The recorded pp data sample was reconstructed with CMSSW software versions CMSSW_7_5_5_patch4 and CMSSW_7_5_5_patch3 using Global Tag 75X\_dataRun2\_Prompt\_ppAt5TeV\_v0. The Monte Carlo samples were all reconstructed with CMSSW\_7\_5\_8\_patch2 and using Global Tag 75X\_mcRun2\_HeavyIon\_v12 for both PbPb Monte Carlo samples and pp Monte Carlo samples using heavy ion reconstruction.

The Z Monte Carlo events are generated using several event generators for crosschecks. The PYQUEN event generator is used to create Z events with a minimum $p_{T}$ cut of 30 GeV/c for the Z and $|\eta|<2.5$ . The PYTHIA 8 event generator is also used to create events with Z having a minimum $p_{T}$ cut of 30 GeV/c and $|\eta|<2.5$ . PYTHIA 8 is also used to create inclusive Z events filtered on having a pair of muons with $p_{T}$ above 10 GeV/c and invariant mass between 60 to 120 GeV/$c^2$ .
